This episode features Scottish percussion's Evelyn Glenn TED Talks who made possible for
support of the MW years Evelyn Glenn.
Of course, my job is all about listening and my aim really is to teach the world to listen.
That's my only real aim in life and it sounds quite simple but actually it's quite a big
job because, you know, when you look at a piece of music, for example, I just look
in my little motorbike bag we have here, hopefully, a piece of music that is cool, a little
black dots on the page and you know, we open it up and I read the music.
So technically, I can actually read this. I will follow the instructions, the tempo markings,
the dynamics, I will do exactly as I'm told and so therefore, because time is short,
if I just play you literally, the first maybe two line-sodes, basically, or there's nothing to
talk about. I mean, speaking here, I'm being told the piece of music is very quick. I'm being told
way out to play on the drum and being told which part the speaker use and I'm being told the dynamic
and I'm also being told that the drum is without snares, so on snares also. So therefore, if I
translate this piece of music, we have this idea.
So my career would probably last about five years. However, what I have to do is a musician.
Is do everything that is not on the music. Everything that isn't time to learn from a teacher
or to talk about even from a teacher. But it's the things that you notice when you're not
actually with your instrument that in fact becomes so interesting and that you you want to
slower to this tiny tiny surface of a drum. So there we experience the translation. Now we'll
experience the interpretation.
My career may last a little longer. But in a way, you know, it's the same time with you and I see
a nice bright young lady with a pink talker and I see that you're touching her teddy bear,
etc. So I get a basic idea as to what you might be about to my life, I do with fashion, etc.
However, that's just, you know, the initial idea I may have that we all get and we actually
look and we try to have actually so I'm going to be shallow. In the same way, I'm looking
music, I get a basic idea, I wonder what technically might be hard or, you know, what I want to do
just the basic feeling. However, that is simply not enough. Please listen, listen. We have to
listen to ourselves, first of all. If I play for example, holding the stick we're literally
I do not let go of the stick. Experience quite a lot of shock coming up through the arm and you
see a really quite leader not detached from the instrument and from the stuck stick, even although
I'm actually holding the stick quite tightly. I mean, I do strangely more detached. If I just simply
let go and allow my hand my arm to be more of a support system, suddenly more dynamic with less effort,
much more. I just feel last one with the stick and one with the drum and I'm doing far
far less. So in the same way that I need time with the instruments, I need time with people in order
to interpret them, not just translate them, but interpret them. If for example, I play just a few
bars of a piece of music for which I think of myself as a technician, not as someone who is basically
a percussion player.
And so let me myself as a musician.
So I'm very some little bit of a difference there. It is work just thinking about and I remember
when I was 12 years old and I started playing to play in percussion and my teacher said well how are
we going to do this? You know music is about listening and I said yes I agree with that. So what's the
problem? And he said well how are you going to hear that? I said well how do you hear it? He said well
I think I hear it through here. I said well I think I do do, but I also hear it through my hands,
my arms, my cheekbones, my skull, tummy, my chest, my legs, and so on. And so we began our lessons
every single time, tuning drums in particular, the kettle drums are simply to such a narrow pitch
interval. So something like that is a difference then gradually and gradually and it's amazing
between you do open your body up and open your hand up to allow the vibration come through
that in fact the tiny tiny difference can be felt with just the tiniest part of your finger there.
And so what we do is that I would pop my hands on the wall as the music room and together we would
listen to sounds of instruments and really try to connect with those sounds far far more broadly
than simply depending on the ear because of the ear is I mean subject to all sorts of things.
The room we happen to be in the application, quality of the instrument, the type of sticks.
It's set to et cetera, they're all different. Same amount of same amount of weight,
but different sound colors. In our space we will rear, we'll just human beings but we all have
our own little sound colors as well that make up his extraordinary personalities and character
and interests things. And as I grew older I then auditioned for the Royal Academy of Music in London
and they said well no we won't accept you because we have a clue you know of the future of
a so-called death musician and I just couldn't quite set that and so therefore I said them well look
if you refuse, if you refuse me through those reasons as opposed to the ability to perform
and to understand and love the art of creating sound then we have to think very very hard about
people you do actually accept and as a result in a once we got over our little hurdle and haven't
to audition twice they accept me and normally that what had happened was it changed the whole
role because the musicians who are the United Kingdom under no circumstances were they to refuse
any application whatsoever on the basis of whether someone had no answer legs it could still perhaps
wear wind instrument if it was supported on a stand no circumstances I call were used to refuse any
entry and every single entry had to be listened to experience and then based on the musical ability
then that person could either enter or not and so therefore this in tone meant that there was an
extremely interesting bunch of students who arrived in these various music institutions and I
have to say many of them now in the professional orchestras throughout the world the interesting thing
about this as well though is quite simply that not only where people connected with sound which is
basically all of us and we well know that music really is our daily medicine I see a music but
actually I mean sound because you know some of the extraordinary things I've experienced as a musician
when you may have a 15 year old lad who is has got the most incredible challenges who may not
be able to control his movements maybe death maybe blind etc etc suddenly if that young lad sits
most to this instrument and perhaps even lies underneath in the room and you place something to
so incredibly organ like almost don't really have the right sticks perhaps but something something like this
something that's so unbelievably simple but he would be experiencing something that I wouldn't be
because I'm on purpose out I sound coming this way he would have the sound coming through the
resolution is that well no resolution on here would have the fullness of sound that those of you
in the front rows of an experience those of you in the back rows wouldn't experience either every
single one of us depending on where we're sitting will experience this sound quite quite differently
and of course being the participator of the sound and that is starting from the idea of what I
hope is sound I want to juice for example this sound you hear anything exactly because I'm not even
touching it yeah we get a sensation there's something happening in the same way that when I see
tree moves then I imagine actually making a ruffling sound you see what I mean so whatever the I
sees then there's always sound happening so there's always always that huge I mean just let's
collide this whole thing to draw drawn so all of my performances are based on entirely what I experience
and not by let me say good and on someone else's interpretation of it buying all the CDs possible
of that particular piece of music and so on and so forth because that isn't giving me enough something
that is so raw and so basic and something that that I can totally experience the journey or so it
may be that in certain halls this dynamic may well work it may be that in other halls there's simply
not going to experience that at all so therefore my level the soft soft gentle leg may have me
so because of this explosion in advance to sound especially through the decommunity this is not
only affected how music institutions how schools for the deaths treat sound and not just as a
means of therapy although of course being a participator of music that definitely is the case as
well but it's meant that are suspicions that have to really think about the types of halls they put together
there are so few halls in this world that actually are have a very good acoustics there I see
right by that I mean where you can absolutely do anything you imagine that the tiniest of soft
sound is something that is so broad so huge so incredible there's always some sand good up there not
so there may be great there terrible up there may be terrible over there not too bad there it's
etcetera so to find an actual is incredible which you can play exactly what you imagine without
being cosmetically in homes and so that's our acquisitions and actually in conversation with
people who are hearing impaired and who are participators of sound and this is this is quite interesting
I cannot you know give you any detail as far as what is actually happening with those halls
but it's just the fact that they are going to group the people for room so many years which so many
years we've been saying for how an African they can these periods be like you know right there
but we just we go like that and we might not get this is about or we go like that and we imagine
that line is about if we see someone in a wheelchair we assume they cannot walk it may be they
can walk three or five steps that to them means they can walk in a year's time could be two extra steps
in another year's time three extra steps those are usually important aspects to think about so
when we do listen each other it's unbelievably important for us to really to really test our listening
skills to really use our bodies as a resonating chamber to stop the judgment for me as a
musician who deals with nine to nine times a new music it's very easy me to say oh yes I like that
he's oh no I might that piece of song and you know I just find that I have to give those pieces
of music real time it may be that the chemistry isn't quite right in myself not the piece of music
but that doesn't mean to say I have the right to say it's a bad piece of music and you know it's just
it's one of the great things about being a musician is that it is so unbelievably fluid so there are
no rules no right will wrong this way that way if I asked you to clap maybe I can do this if I can just
say please clap and be able to sound a thunder I'm assuming we've all experienced thunder now I don't
mean just a sound I mean really listen to that thunder within yourselves and please try to create
that and be up in five please five there's a little slow have you ever heard snow well then stop laughing
try again try again snow you're awake rain not bad not bad you know the interesting thing
year though is that I asked a group of kids not so long ago exactly the same question now
great imagination very much however not one of you've got out of your seats to think like how can I
clap okay maybe I'm already as the sounds maybe I can be the other part of my body as the sound
not a single one of you thought about clapping in a slightly different way other than sitting in
your seats there and using two hands in the same way that when you listen to music we assume that
you know it's all being shared through here this is how we experience music of course it's not
we experience thunder thunder thunder think think listen listen listen listen now what can we do with
thunder I remember my teacher when when I first got my very first lesson I was all prepared
with sticks ready to go and instead of him saying okay Edland please you know each slide they are
arms are more or less 90 degree angle sticks and a more or less v-shake keep it closer mine
to space here etc please keep your back straight etc etc where I was just probably going to
end up with rigid rows and I would not be able to strike drum because I think there's so many
other things is that Edland take this drum away for seven days and I'll see you next week so Kevin's
what was I to do right I didn't I no longer were the sticks I wasn't allowed to have these sticks
I had to basically look at this drum she had was made what these little lugs did what
the snares did turned it upside down experiment shell experiment it's my body
experiment with all sorts of things and of course I returned with all sorts of
bruises I got it never the less you know it was such an unbelievable experience because then
where on air are you going to experience that in a piece of music where on air are you going to
experience that in a study book so we never ever dealt with actual study books so for example one of
things that we learned when we are dealing with being a percussion player as a goes through a musician
is basically straight forward single stroke rows like that I'm getting a little faster
what is this piece of quiet single stroke rules why don't you that was learning
of music and that's exactly what he did and interestingly all the I became and when I became a full
time student at a so-called music institution or all of that went out of the window we had to study
and study books and constantly the question well why why what is this relating to I need to
a piece of music oh well this will help you control well how why do I need to learn that I need to
relate it to a piece if music you know I need to say something why am I practicing how did it also
it's literally for control for hand-spick control why am I going to have the reason and the reason
has to be by saying something through the music and by saying something through music basically is
sound we then can reach all sorts of things to all sorts of people but I don't want to get
responsibility if you're emotional baggage that's up to you when you walk through a hole because
that then determines what and how we listen to certains I made your sort of all or happy or
exhilarated or angry when I play certains is music but I'm not necessarily wanting you will be all
exactly the same thing so please the next time you you go to a concert just allow your body open up
to allow your body to be this resonating chamber be aware that you're not going to experience the same
thing as the performer is the performer is in the work possible position for the actual sound
is we are viewing the contact of the stick on the or the mallet on the bit of wood or the bow on the
string etc or the breath that's that's creating the sound from wind and brass there are
experiencing that rawness there did yet that experiencing something so unbelievably pure which is
before the sound is actually happening please take note if the life sound after the actual
initial strike or breath is being pulled just experience the whole jump so I just ask
have a lenders to give us a treat and just a three minute performance of happy it's on that
the
Thank you very much for having me.
