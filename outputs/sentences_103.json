  "TED Talks are recorded live at TED Copprens and produced with WNYC New York Public\nGreat.",
  "This episode features Scottish percussion's Evelyn Glenn TED Talks who made possible for\nsupport of the MW years Evelyn Glenn.",
  "Of course, my job is all about listening and my aim really is to teach the world to listen.",
  "That's my only real aim in life and it sounds quite simple but actually it's quite a big\njob because, you know, when you look at a piece of music, for example, I just look\nin my little motorbike bag we have here, hopefully, a piece of music that is cool, a little\nblack dots on the page and you know, we open it up and I read the music.",
  "So technically, I can actually read this.",
  "I will follow the instructions, the tempo markings,\nthe dynamics, I will do exactly as I'm told and so therefore, because time is short,\nif I just play you literally, the first maybe two line-sodes, basically, or there's nothing to\ntalk about.",
  "I mean, speaking here, I'm being told the piece of music is very quick.",
  "I'm being told\nway out to play on the drum and being told which part the speaker use and I'm being told the dynamic\nand I'm also being told that the drum is without snares, so on snares also.",
  "So therefore, if I\ntranslate this piece of music, we have this idea.",
  "So my career would probably last about five years.",
  "However, what I have to do is a musician.",
  "Is do everything that is not on the music.",
  "Everything that isn't time to learn from a teacher\nor to talk about even from a teacher.",
  "But it's the things that you notice when you're not\nactually with your instrument that in fact becomes so interesting and that you you want to\nslower to this tiny tiny surface of a drum.",
  "So there we experience the translation.",
  "Now we'll\nexperience the interpretation.",
  "My career may last a little longer.",
  "But in a way, you know, it's the same time with you and I see\na nice bright young lady with a pink talker and I see that you're touching her teddy bear,\netc.",
  "So I get a basic idea as to what you might be about to my life, I do with fashion, etc.",
  "However, that's just, you know, the initial idea I may have that we all get and we actually\nlook and we try to have actually so I'm going to be shallow.",
  "In the same way, I'm looking\nmusic, I get a basic idea, I wonder what technically might be hard or, you know, what I want to do\njust the basic feeling.",
  "However, that is simply not enough.",
  "Please listen, listen.",
  "We have to\nlisten to ourselves, first of all.",
  "If I play for example, holding the stick we're literally\nI do not let go of the stick.",
  "Experience quite a lot of shock coming up through the arm and you\nsee a really quite leader not detached from the instrument and from the stuck stick, even although\nI'm actually holding the stick quite tightly.",
  "I mean, I do strangely more detached.",
  "If I just simply\nlet go and allow my hand my arm to be more of a support system, suddenly more dynamic with less effort,\nmuch more.",
  "I just feel last one with the stick and one with the drum and I'm doing far\nfar less.",
  "So in the same way that I need time with the instruments, I need time with people in order\nto interpret them, not just translate them, but interpret them.",
  "If for example, I play just a few\nbars of a piece of music for which I think of myself as a technician, not as someone who is basically\na percussion player.",
  "And so let me myself as a musician.",
  "So I'm very some little bit of a difference there.",
  "It is work just thinking about and I remember\nwhen I was 12 years old and I started playing to play in percussion and my teacher said well how are\nwe going to do this?",
  "You know music is about listening and I said yes I agree with that.",
  "So what's the\nproblem?",
  "And he said well how are you going to hear that?",
  "I said well how do you hear it?",
  "He said well\nI think I hear it through here.",
  "I said well I think I do do, but I also hear it through my hands,\nmy arms, my cheekbones, my skull, tummy, my chest, my legs, and so on.",
  "And so we began our lessons\nevery single time, tuning drums in particular, the kettle drums are simply to such a narrow pitch\ninterval.",
  "So something like that is a difference then gradually and gradually and it's amazing\nbetween you do open your body up and open your hand up to allow the vibration come through\nthat in fact the tiny tiny difference can be felt with just the tiniest part of your finger there.",
  "And so what we do is that I would pop my hands on the wall as the music room and together we would\nlisten to sounds of instruments and really try to connect with those sounds far far more broadly\nthan simply depending on the ear because of the ear is I mean subject to all sorts of things.",
  "The room we happen to be in the application, quality of the instrument, the type of sticks.",
  "It's set to et cetera, they're all different.",
  "Same amount of same amount of weight,\nbut different sound colors.",
  "In our space we will rear, we'll just human beings but we all have\nour own little sound colors as well that make up his extraordinary personalities and character\nand interests things.",
  "And as I grew older I then auditioned for the Royal Academy of Music in London\nand they said well no we won't accept you because we have a clue you know of the future of\na so-called death musician and I just couldn't quite set that and so therefore I said them well look\nif you refuse, if you refuse me through those reasons as opposed to the ability to perform\nand to understand and love the art of creating sound then we have to think very very hard about\npeople you do actually accept and as a result in a once we got over our little hurdle and haven't\nto audition twice they accept me and normally that what had happened was it changed the whole\nrole because the musicians who are the United Kingdom under no circumstances were they to refuse\nany application whatsoever on the basis of whether someone had no answer legs it could still perhaps\nwear wind instrument if it was supported on a stand no circumstances I call were used to refuse any\nentry and every single entry had to be listened to experience and then based on the musical ability\nthen that person could either enter or not and so therefore this in tone meant that there was an\nextremely interesting bunch of students who arrived in these various music institutions and I\nhave to say many of them now in the professional orchestras throughout the world the interesting thing\nabout this as well though is quite simply that not only where people connected with sound which is\nbasically all of us and we well know that music really is our daily medicine I see a music but\nactually I mean sound because you know some of the extraordinary things I've experienced as a musician\nwhen you may have a 15 year old lad who is has got the most incredible challenges who may not\nbe able to control his movements maybe death maybe blind etc etc suddenly if that young lad sits\nmost to this instrument and perhaps even lies underneath in the room and you place something to\nso incredibly organ like almost don't really have the right sticks perhaps but something something like this\nsomething that's so unbelievably simple but he would be experiencing something that I wouldn't be\nbecause I'm on purpose out I sound coming this way he would have the sound coming through the\nresolution is that well no resolution on here would have the fullness of sound that those of you\nin the front rows of an experience those of you in the back rows wouldn't experience either every\nsingle one of us depending on where we're sitting will experience this sound quite quite differently\nand of course being the participator of the sound and that is starting from the idea of what I\nhope is sound I want to juice for example this sound you hear anything exactly because I'm not even\ntouching it yeah we get a sensation there's something happening in the same way that when I see\ntree moves then I imagine actually making a ruffling sound you see what I mean so whatever the I\nsees then there's always sound happening so there's always always that huge I mean just let's\ncollide this whole thing to draw drawn so all of my performances are based on entirely what I experience\nand not by let me say good and on someone else's interpretation of it buying all the CDs possible\nof that particular piece of music and so on and so forth because that isn't giving me enough something\nthat is so raw and so basic and something that that I can totally experience the journey or so it\nmay be that in certain halls this dynamic may well work it may be that in other halls there's simply\nnot going to experience that at all so therefore my level the soft soft gentle leg may have me\nso because of this explosion in advance to sound especially through the decommunity this is not\nonly affected how music institutions how schools for the deaths treat sound and not just as a\nmeans of therapy although of course being a participator of music that definitely is the case as\nwell but it's meant that are suspicions that have to really think about the types of halls they put together\nthere are so few halls in this world that actually are have a very good acoustics there I see\nright by that I mean where you can absolutely do anything you imagine that the tiniest of soft\nsound is something that is so broad so huge so incredible there's always some sand good up there not\nso there may be great there terrible up there may be terrible over there not too bad there it's\netcetera so to find an actual is incredible which you can play exactly what you imagine without\nbeing cosmetically in homes and so that's our acquisitions and actually in conversation with\npeople who are hearing impaired and who are participators of sound and this is this is quite interesting\nI cannot you know give you any detail as far as what is actually happening with those halls\nbut it's just the fact that they are going to group the people for room so many years which so many\nyears we've been saying for how an African they can these periods be like you know right there\nbut we just we go like that and we might not get this is about or we go like that and we imagine\nthat line is about if we see someone in a wheelchair we assume they cannot walk it may be they\ncan walk three or five steps that to them means they can walk in a year's time could be two extra steps\nin another year's time three extra steps those are usually important aspects to think about so\nwhen we do listen each other it's unbelievably important for us to really to really test our listening\nskills to really use our bodies as a resonating chamber to stop the judgment for me as a\nmusician who deals with nine to nine times a new music it's very easy me to say oh yes I like that\nhe's oh no I might that piece of song and you know I just find that I have to give those pieces\nof music real time it may be that the chemistry isn't quite right in myself not the piece of music\nbut that doesn't mean to say I have the right to say it's a bad piece of music and you know it's just\nit's one of the great things about being a musician is that it is so unbelievably fluid so there are\nno rules no right will wrong this way that way if I asked you to clap maybe I can do this if I can just\nsay please clap and be able to sound a thunder I'm assuming we've all experienced thunder now I don't\nmean just a sound I mean really listen to that thunder within yourselves and please try to create\nthat and be up in five please five there's a little slow have you ever heard snow well then stop laughing\ntry again try again snow you're awake rain not bad not bad you know the interesting thing\nyear though is that I asked a group of kids not so long ago exactly the same question now\ngreat imagination very much however not one of you've got out of your seats to think like how can I\nclap okay maybe I'm already as the sounds maybe I can be the other part of my body as the sound\nnot a single one of you thought about clapping in a slightly different way other than sitting in\nyour seats there and using two hands in the same way that when you listen to music we assume that\nyou know it's all being shared through here this is how we experience music of course it's not\nwe experience thunder thunder thunder think think listen listen listen listen now what can we do with\nthunder I remember my teacher when when I first got my very first lesson I was all prepared\nwith sticks ready to go and instead of him saying okay Edland please you know each slide they are\narms are more or less 90 degree angle sticks and a more or less v-shake keep it closer mine\nto space here etc please keep your back straight etc etc where I was just probably going to\nend up with rigid rows and I would not be able to strike drum because I think there's so many\nother things is that Edland take this drum away for seven days and I'll see you next week so Kevin's\nwhat was I to do right I didn't I no longer were the sticks I wasn't allowed to have these sticks\nI had to basically look at this drum she had was made what these little lugs did what\nthe snares did turned it upside down experiment shell experiment it's my body\nexperiment with all sorts of things and of course I returned with all sorts of\nbruises I got it never the less you know it was such an unbelievable experience because then\nwhere on air are you going to experience that in a piece of music where on air are you going to\nexperience that in a study book so we never ever dealt with actual study books so for example one of\nthings that we learned when we are dealing with being a percussion player as a goes through a musician\nis basically straight forward single stroke rows like that I'm getting a little faster\nwhat is this piece of quiet single stroke rules why don't you that was learning\nof music and that's exactly what he did and interestingly all the I became and when I became a full\ntime student at a so-called music institution or all of that went out of the window we had to study\nand study books and constantly the question well why why what is this relating to I need to\na piece of music oh well this will help you control well how why do I need to learn that I need to\nrelate it to a piece if music you know I need to say something why am I practicing how did it also\nit's literally for control for hand-spick control why am I going to have the reason and the reason\nhas to be by saying something through the music and by saying something through music basically is\nsound we then can reach all sorts of things to all sorts of people but I don't want to get\nresponsibility if you're emotional baggage that's up to you when you walk through a hole because\nthat then determines what and how we listen to certains I made your sort of all or happy or\nexhilarated or angry when I play certains is music but I'm not necessarily wanting you will be all\nexactly the same thing so please the next time you you go to a concert just allow your body open up\nto allow your body to be this resonating chamber be aware that you're not going to experience the same\nthing as the performer is the performer is in the work possible position for the actual sound\nis we are viewing the contact of the stick on the or the mallet on the bit of wood or the bow on the\nstring etc or the breath that's that's creating the sound from wind and brass there are\nexperiencing that rawness there did yet that experiencing something so unbelievably pure which is\nbefore the sound is actually happening please take note if the life sound after the actual\ninitial strike or breath is being pulled just experience the whole jump so I just ask\nhave a lenders to give us a treat and just a three minute performance of happy it's on that\nthe\nThank you very much for having me.",
