  "1": "When he was 12 years old he auditioned for the Royal Academy of Music in London. They said well no we won't accept you because we have a clue you know of the future of a so-called death musician. So therefore he said them well look if you refuse, if they refuse me through those reasons as opposed to the ability to perform then we have to think very very hard about people you do actually accept. As a result in a once we got over our little hurdle and haven't to audition twice they accept me.",
  "2": "\"I get a basic idea as to what you might be about to my life, I do with fashion, etc. However, that's just, you know, the initial idea I may have that we all get and we actually look\" \"I just look in my little motorbike bag we have here, hopefully, a piece of music that is cool\" \"It's just a little bit of my life\"",
  "4": "\"Technically, I can actually read this. I'm being told way out to play on the drum and being told which part the speaker use\" \"I'm also being told that the drum is without snares, so on snare also. So there we experience the translation. Now we'll experience the interpretation\" \"We're playing the music, we're not playing the words\"",

If I just simply let go and allow my hand my arm to be more of a support system, suddenly more dynamic with less effort, much more,\" he says. \"So I'm very some little bit of a difference there. So what's the problem?\" he asks. \"I'm very very detached,\" he adds. \"If I just let go, my arm is more of an support system\"",
  "5": "\"The tiny tiny difference can be felt with just the tiniest part of your finger there,\" she says. \"So something like that is a difference then gradually and gradually and it's amazing between you do open your body up and open your hand up to allow the vibration come through that in fact the tiny tiny Difference\" \"It's amazing,\" she adds. \"You can feel it. It's amazing\""
