    "Here's Ikbal Kadeer."
  ],
  "124": [
    "We should ask ourselves the question, why does poverty exist?"
  ],
  "119": [
    "I mean, there's plenty of knowledge and scientific breakthroughs."
  ],
  "129": [
    "We all live in the same planet, but it's still a great deal of poverty in the world."
  ],
  "70": [
    "And I think, so I want to throw a perspective that I have so that we can assess this project or any other project, for that matter, to see whether it's contributing or contributing to poverty or trying to elevate it."
  ],
  "14": [
    "But to start that, remember that rich countries have been sending aid to poor countries for last 60 years.",
    "Poor countries need aid."
  ],
  "123": [
    "And by and large, this has failed."
  ],
  "85": [
    "The question is, why is that?"
  ],
  "121": [
    "In my mind, there is something to learn from the history of Europe."
  ],
  "106": [
    "There's a lot of struggle has gone in Europe."
  ],
  "77": [
    "There were citizens who were empowered by technologies, and they demanded authorities to come down from their high horses."
  ],
  "89": [
    "And in the end, there's better bargaining between the authorities and citizens and democracies, capitalism, everything else flourished."
  ],
  "131": [
    "But if you have that perspective, then you can see what happened in the last 60 years."
  ],
  "116": [
    "Aid actually did the opposite."
  ],
  "3": [
    "It empowered authorities, and as a result, marginalized citizens.",
    "It empowers authorities without activating the citizens."
  ],
  "127": [
    "The authorities did not have the reason to make economic growth happen so that they could tax people and make more money for to run their business."
  ],
  "109": [
    "Because they were getting it from abroad."
  ],
  "93": [
    "And in fact, if you see all rich countries where citizens are not yet empowered, the same thing goes."
  ],
  "87": [
    "Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, all sorts of countries."
  ],
  "104": [
    "Because the aid and oil or mineral money acts the same way."
  ],
  "83": [
    "Their hands, legs, brains, what have you."
  ],
  "76": [
    "And if you agree with that, then I think the best way to improve these countries is to recognize that economic development is of the people, by the people, for the people."
  ],
  "101": [
    "And that is the real network effect."
  ],
  "86": [
    "If citizens can network and make themselves more organized and productive, so that their voices are heard, so then things would improve."
  ],
  "90": [
    "And to contrast that, you can see the most important institution in the world, the World Bank, is an organization of the government, by the government, for the governments."
  ],
  "100": [
    "And that is the perspective I have."
  ],
  "97": [
    "And then I can start my story."
  ],
  "117": [
    "Of course, how would you empower citizens?"
  ],
  "88": [
    "There could be all sorts of technologies."
  ],
  "111": [
    "And one is cell phones."
  ],
  "78": [
    "So 12 years ago, I was trying to be an investment banker in New York."
  ],
  "133": [
    "Our colleagues were connected by a computer network."
  ],
  "118": [
    "We got more productive because we didn't have to exchange floppy disks."
  ],
  "74": [
    "We could update each other more often."
  ],
  "99": [
    "But one time it broke down."
  ],
  "103": [
    "And it reminded me of a day in 1971, there was a war going on in my country."
  ],
  "115": [
    "And my family moved out of a urban place where we used to live to remote rural area, where it was safer."
  ],
  "69": [
    "And one time my mother asked me to get some medicine for a younger sibling."
  ],
  "120": [
    "And I walked 10 miles or so all morning to get there to the medicine man."
  ],
  "125": [
    "And he wasn't there, so I walked all afternoon back."
  ],
  "91": [
    "So I had another unproductive day."
  ],
  "113": [
    "So while I was sitting in a tall building in New York, I put the two experiences together side by side."
  ],
  "8": [
    "And basically concluded that connectivity is productivity, whether it's in a modern office or an underdeveloped village.",
    "But in any event, it's connectivity that leads to dependability, and that leads to specialization, that leads to productivity."
  ],
  "114": [
    "So naturally, the implication of that is that the telephone is a weapon against poverty."
  ],
  "58": [
    "And if that's the case, then question is how many telephones do we have at that time?"
  ],
  "2": [
    "And it turns out that there was one telephone in Bangladesh for every 500 people.",
    "The question was how much did it cost to install a new telephone in Bangladesh?"
  ],
  "56": [
    "And all those phones were in its few urban places."
  ],
  "38": [
    "The vast rural areas where 100 million people lived, there were no telephones."
  ],
  "98": [
    "So just imagine how many man, months, or man years are wasted, just like I wasted a day."
  ],
  "105": [
    "If you just multiply by 100 million people, let's say losing one day a month, whatever."
  ],
  "128": [
    "And you see a vast amount of resource wasted."
  ],
  "81": [
    "And after all, poor countries, like rich countries, one thing we got equal is that days are same length, 24 hours."
  ],
  "68": [
    "So if you lose that precious resource where you are somewhat equal to the richer countries, that's a huge waste."
  ],
  "63": [
    "It turns out $2,000."
  ],
  "71": [
    "So if you spend $2,000, and let's say the telephone lasts 10 years, and it's $5,000 every year."
  ],
  "57": [
    "So that's $50,000."
  ],
  "107": [
    "So obviously this was a gadget to have."
  ],
  "134": [
    "And of course, if the cost of installing a telephone is going down, because there's a digital revolution going on, then it would be even more dramatic."
  ],
  "132": [
    "And I knew little economics by then."
  ],
  "110": [
    "It says Adam Smith taught us that specialization leads to productivity."
  ],
  "75": [
    "But how would you specialize?"
  ],
  "84": [
    "Let's say I'm a fisherman and a farmer, and Chris is a fisherman farmer, both are generalists."
  ],
  "102": [
    "Generally I would start fishing, he would start farming only when we can depend on each other."
  ],
  "108": [
    "The point is that we could only depend on each other if we can connect with each other."
  ],
  "79": [
    "And if we're neighbors, I could just walk over to his house, but then we're limiting our economic sphere to something very small area."
  ],
  "73": [
    "But in order to expand that, you need a river, or you need a highway, or you need telephone lines."
  ],
  "55": [
    "So the question was, I started looking at this issue, and going back and forth between Bangladesh and New York."
  ],
  "7": [
    "There were a lot of reasons people told me why we don't have enough telephones.",
    "But you know, they have, after all, evolved in a country without telephones."
  ],
  "49": [
    "And one of them is the lacking buying power."
  ],
  "126": [
    "Poor people apparently don't have the power to buy."
  ],
  "130": [
    "But the point is, if it's a production tool, why do we have to worry about that?"
  ],
  "92": [
    "I mean, in America, people buy cars, and they put very little money down."
  ],
  "28": [
    "They get a car, and they go to work."
  ],
  "72": [
    "They work, paste them a salary."
  ],
  "4": [
    "The salary allows them to pay for the car over time.",
    "The car pays for itself."
  ],
  "94": [
    "So if telephone is a production tool, then we don't quite have to worry about the purchasing power."
  ],
  "60": [
    "And of course, even if that's true, then what about initial buying power?"
  ],
  "36": [
    "So then the question is, why can't we have some kind of shared access?"
  ],
  "6": [
    "In the United States, we have everybody needs banking service, but very few of us are trying to buy a bank.",
    "So a bank tends to serve a whole community."
  ],
  "61": [
    "So we could do that for telephones."
  ],
  "95": [
    "And also people told me that we have a lot of important primary needs to meet, food, clothing, shelter, whatever."
  ],
  "41": [
    "But again, it's very paternalistic."
  ],
  "80": [
    "You should be raising income and let people decide what they want to do with their money."
  ],
  "0": [
    "But the real problem is the lack of other infrastructures.",
    "So you need some kind of infrastructure to bring a new thing."
  ],
  "44": [
    "For instance, the internet was booming in the US because there were people had computers, they had modems, they had telephone lines."
  ],
  "46": [
    "So it's very easy to bring in a new idea like the internet."
  ],
  "64": [
    "But that's what's lacking in a poor country."
  ],
  "50": [
    "So for example, we didn't have ways to have credit checks, a few banks to collect bills, et cetera."
  ],
  "54": [
    "But that's why I noticed Gram in Bank, which was a bank for poor people and had 1,100 branches, 2,000 employees, 2.3 million borrowers."
  ],
  "59": [
    "So I started, I first went to them and said, you know, perhaps I could collect all your branches and make you more efficient."
  ],
  "37": [
    "So they are decentralized."
  ],
  "29": [
    "I mean, of course, there might be other good reasons, but this was one other reason."
  ],
  "96": [
    "They had to be."
  ],
  "45": [
    "And so they were not that interested to connect all their branches and suddenly be and rock the boat."
  ],
  "39": [
    "So I started focusing."
  ],
  "43": [
    "What is it that they really do?"
  ],
  "51": [
    "So what happens is that somebody borrowers money from the bank."
  ],
  "65": [
    "She typically buys a cow."
  ],
  "82": [
    "The cow gives milk and she sells the milk to the villagers and pays off the loan."
  ],
  "47": [
    "And this is a business for her, but it's milk for everybody else."
  ],
  "27": [
    "And suddenly I realized that a cell phone could be a cow because somebody, she could borrow $200 from the bank, get a phone, and have the phone for everybody and it's a business for her."
  ],
  "53": [
    "And I wrote to the bank and they thought for a while and they said, little crazy, but logical."
  ],
  "18": [
    "If you think it can be done, come and make it happen."
  ],
  "34": [
    "So I quit my job."
  ],
  "42": [
    "I went back to Bangladesh."
  ],
  "67": [
    "I created a company in America called GonoFone, which is in Bengali means people's phone."
  ],
  "40": [
    "And angel investors in America put in money into that."
  ],
  "24": [
    "I flew around the world."
  ],
  "52": [
    "After about a million, I mean, I got rejected from lots of places because I was not only trying to go to a poor country, I was trying to go to the poor of the poor country."
  ],
  "22": [
    "So after about a million miles and a meaningful, I guess substantial loss of hair, I eventually put together a consortium and which involved the Norwegian telephone company which provided the know-how and the Grammy in Bank provided the infrastructure to spread the service."
  ],
  "66": [
    "Now that cow model I talked about, there are about 115,000 people who are retailing telephone services in their neighborhoods."
  ],
  "25": [
    "And it's serving 52,000 villages, which represent about 80 million people."
  ],
  "48": [
    "And these phones are generating about 100 million dollars for the company and two dollars profit per entrepreneur per day, which is like $700 per year."
  ],
  "21": [
    "The result is right now this company is the largest telephone company with 3.5 million subscribers, 115,000."
  ],
  "31": [
    "These phones I talked about that produces about a third of the traffic in the network."
  ],
  "62": [
    "And 2004, the net profit after taxes, very serious taxes, was $120 million."
  ],
  "26": [
    "And the company contributed about $190 million to the government coffers."
  ],
  "19": [
    "Here are some of the lessons the government needs to provide economically viable services."
  ],
  "12": [
    "Actually this is an instance where private companies can provide that."
  ],
  "10": [
    "Governments need to subsidize private companies.",
    "And actually private companies help governments with taxes."
  ],
  "13": [
    "This is what some people think."
  ],
  "32": [
    "Poor people are recipients, poor people are a resource."
  ],
  "5": [
    "These costs too much for the poor.",
    "The poor are uneducated and cannot do much."
  ],
  "35": [
    "Their involvement reduces the costs."
  ],
  "33": [
    "They are very eager learners and very capable survivors."
  ],
  "23": [
    "Most of them learn how to operate a telephone within a day."
  ],
  "16": [
    "Businesses, this one company has raised the if the ITU figures are even 5% through."
  ],
  "17": [
    "This one company is raising the GNP of the country."
  ],
  "1": [
    "Much more than the aid the country receives.",
    "And as I was trying to show you, as far as I'm concerned, aid does damages because it removes the government from its citizens."
  ],
  "11": [
    "Thank you."
  ],
  "30": [
    "That was itbal Kadir, recorded at Ted Global in Oxford, England, July 2005."
