I just couldn't quite set that and so therefore I said them well look if you refuse me through those reasons as opposed to the ability to perform and to understand and love the art of creating sound. As a result in a once we got over our little hurdle and haven't to audition twice they accept me. There are so few halls in this world that actually are have a very good acoustics there I see right by that I mean where you can absolutely do anything you imagine. To find an actual is incredible which you can play exactly what you imagine without being cosmetically in homes and so that's our acquisitions and actually in conversation with people who are hearing impaired and who are participators of sound. \"When we do listen each other it's unbelievably important for us to really to really test our listening skills to really use our bodies as a resonating chamber to stop the judgment\" \"If I asked you to clap maybe I can do this if I can just say please clap and be able to sound a thunder I'm assuming we've all experienced thunder now I don't mean just a sound\" When I first got my very first lesson I was all prepared with sticks ready to go and instead of him saying okay Edland please you know each slide they are arms are more or less 90 degree angle sticks. I had to basically look at this drum she had was made what these little lugs did what the snares did turned it upside down. Of course I returned with all sorts of bruises I got it never the less. When I play certains is music but I'm not necessarily wanting you will be all exactly the same thing so please the next time you you go to a concert just allow your body open up to allowyour body to be this resonating chamber be aware that you're not going to experience the same things as the performer.",
